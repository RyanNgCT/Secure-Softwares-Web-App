# Secure-Softwares-Web-App

Web App created for a fictitious software sales company using ASP .NET Razor Pages.

In this project, we aim to create a web application that sells software products. The goal of this webpage is to ensure that users have a secure distribution service to purchase their softwares from. The webpage must provide authentication and authorisation to provide better security, and must also be resistant to cyberattacks such as SQL injection attacks, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Whilst having security safeguards, the website should also not compromise on its usability so that users can use it intuitively as intended as a secure software sales web application.
